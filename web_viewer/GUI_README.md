## Files Created

### Core Application
- `server_manager_gui.py` - Main GUI application
- `gui_requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `build_gui.bat` - Build script to create executable

### Build Output
- `ThermoAPI_Server_Manager.exe` - Compiled executable (after build)
- `dist/` - PyInstaller build directory
- `build/` - PyInstaller temporary files
- `ThermoAPI_Server_Manager.spec` - PyInstaller specification

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Run the Executable (Recommended)
1. **Build the executable** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   double-click build_gui.bat
   ```
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   double-click ThermoAPI_Server_Manager.exe
   ```

### Method 2: Run Python Script Directly
1. **Test dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python test_dependencies.py
   ```
2. **Test Node.js/npm**:
   ```bash
   python test_nodejs.py
   ```
3. **Test backend setup (if having issues)**:
   ```bash
   python test_backend.py
   ```
4. **Install missing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil requests
   ```
4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python server_manager_gui.py
   ```

## Building the Executable

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- pip package manager
- Internet connection (for downloading packages)

### Method 1: Using the PATH Fix Build Script (Recommended)
1. **Test dependencies first**:
   ```bash
   python test_dependencies.py
   ```
2. **Run the PATH fix build script**:
   ```bash
   build_gui_path_fix.bat
   ```
3. **Wait for completion** - The script will:
   - Check Python and tkinter availability
   - Install required packages using `python -m pip`
   - Test all imports
   - Build the executable using `python -m PyInstaller` (bypasses PATH issues)
   - Copy the result to the current directory

4. **Find your executable**: `ThermoAPI_Server_Manager.exe`

### Method 2: Using the Fixed Build Script
1. **Run the fixed build script**:
   ```bash
   build_gui_fixed.bat
   ```
   Note: May fail if PyInstaller is not in PATH.

### Method 3: Using the Original Build Script
1. **Run the build script**:
   ```bash
   build_gui.bat
   ```
   Note: This may fail if tkinter or PATH issues occur.

2. **What the build script does**:
   - Installs required Python packages
   - Uses PyInstaller to create a standalone executable
   - Copies the executable to the current directory
   - Creates a single-file executable with no external dependencies

3. **Build options used**:
   - `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file
   - `--windowed`: Runs without console window
   - `--name`: Sets executable name to "ThermoAPI_Server_Manager"

### Manual Build (Alternative)
If you prefer to build manually:
```bash
pip install -r gui_requirements.txt
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "ThermoAPI_Server_Manager" server_manager_gui.py
copy dist\ThermoAPI_Server_Manager.exe .
```

## Using the GUI

### Main Interface
1. **Server Status Panel**:
   - Shows current status of backend and frontend servers
   - Displays server URLs when running
   - Updates automatically every 2 seconds

2. **Control Buttons**:
   - **Start Servers**: Launches both backend and frontend
   - **Stop Servers**: Terminates all server processes
   - **Refresh Status**: Manually updates server status

3. **Activity Log**:
   - Shows timestamped messages for all operations
   - Displays startup/shutdown progress
   - Reports errors and status changes
   - **Clear Log** button to reset the log

### Server Management

#### Starting Servers
1. Click **"Start Servers"** button
2. Backend starts first (Python Flask on port 5000)
3. Frontend starts after 3-second delay (Vite on port 3000/3001)
4. Status indicators turn green when servers are running
5. Server URLs appear next to status indicators

#### Stopping Servers
1. Click **"Stop Servers"** button
2. Application terminates tracked processes
3. Performs port-based cleanup for thorough shutdown
4. Status indicators turn red when servers are stopped

### Status Indicators
- **üî¥ Red "Stopped"**: Server is not running
- **üü¢ Green "Running"**: Server is active and responding
- **Blue URLs**: Click to open server in browser

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **tkinter**: GUI framework (built into Python)
- **psutil**: Process and system monitoring
- **requests**: HTTP client for health checks
- **subprocess**: Process management
- **threading**: Background monitoring
- **pathlib**: File system operations

### Architecture
- **Main Thread**: GUI updates and user interactions
- **Background Threads**: Server monitoring and process management
- **Process Tracking**: Maintains references to started processes
- **Port Monitoring**: Checks for active listeners on server ports

### Server Detection
- **Backend**: Monitors port 5000 for Flask server
- **Frontend**: Monitors ports 3000 and 3001 for Vite dev server
- **Health Checks**: Attempts HTTP requests to verify server response
- **Process Tracking**: Uses psutil to find processes by port binding

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
1. **"'pyinstaller' is not recognized as an internal or external command"**:
   - PyInstaller is installed but not in PATH
   - Use `build_gui_path_fix.bat` (uses `python -m PyInstaller`)
   - Or manually add `%APPDATA%\Python\Python313\Scripts` to your PATH
   - Alternative: Use `python -m PyInstaller` instead of `pyinstaller`

2. **"Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tkinter"**:
   - tkinter is built into Python and doesn't need pip installation
   - Use `build_gui_fixed.bat` or `build_gui_path_fix.bat`
   - Run `python test_dependencies.py` to verify tkinter availability
   - If tkinter is missing, reinstall Python with tkinter support

3. **"Python not found"**: 
   - Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH
   - Download from https://python.org

4. **"Permission denied"**: 
   - Run as administrator
   - Check antivirus settings (may block PyInstaller)

### Runtime Issues
1. **"Module not found"**: 
   - Install missing dependencies: `pip install psutil requests`
   - Run dependency test: `python test_dependencies.py`

2. **"Failed to start frontend: npm not found"**:
   - Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (includes npm)
   - Run `python test_nodejs.py` to verify installation
   - Ensure Node.js is added to your system PATH
   - Try restarting your computer after Node.js installation

3. **"Failed to start frontend: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified"**:
   - This usually means npm is not found or not in PATH
   - Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
   - Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
   - Use the updated GUI executable with better npm detection

### Backend Server Issues

1. **"Failed to start backend: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified"**
   - Python is not installed or not in PATH
   - Solution: Install Python from python.org and ensure it's added to PATH
   - Alternative: Use `py` command instead of `python`

2. **"Backend server failed to start properly"**
   - Missing Python dependencies
   - Solution: Run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
   - Check if all required packages are installed
   - **Use the "Test Backend" button in the GUI for detailed diagnostics**

3. **"Failed to start backend server with any Python command"**
   - Multiple Python installation issues
   - Missing required packages (flask, flask-socketio, flask-cors, pythonnet)
   - Solution: 
     - Run `python test_backend.py` for detailed diagnostics
     - Install missing packages: `pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors pythonnet`
     - Try using `py` instead of `python`

4. **"Port 5000 already in use"**
   - Another application is using port 5000
   - Solution: Stop other applications or restart your computer

5. **Backend starts manually but fails from GUI**
   - Environment or PATH differences between manual and GUI execution
   - Solution: Use the "Test Backend" button to compare environments
   - Check if virtual environment is activated when running manually

4. **Servers won't start**: 
   - Check if ports 5000/3000/3001 are available
   - Ensure backend/frontend directories exist
   - Check if Python/Node.js are installed
   - Run dependency tests: `python test_dependencies.py` and `python test_nodejs.py`

5. **GUI doesn't respond**: 
   - Check if backend/frontend directories exist
   - Verify server scripts are in the correct location
   - Check Windows firewall settings

### GUI Issues
- **Window doesn't appear**: Check if running in background processes
- **Status not updating**: Click "Refresh Status" button
- **Log not scrolling**: Click in log area and scroll manually
